# VS Code Markdown Preview for Azure DevOps TOC

The `vscode-azdo-toc` extension adds rendering for Azure DevOps wiki table of contents tags (`[[_TOC_]]`) to the VS Code Markdown preview.

This extension is a fork of the [Azure DevOps Wiki Markdown extension here](https://github.com/ni/vscode-azdo-wiki-md-extension), released under the [MIT license](https://github.com/ni/vscode-azdo-wiki-md-extension/blob/master/LICENSE). It offers _only_ the TOC rendering preview and does not include the extra emoji and other support included there. This allows it to work better alongside existing, smaller Markdown extensions.

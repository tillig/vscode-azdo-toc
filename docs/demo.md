[[_TOC_]]

This page shows a table of contents with different headings. Something you'll notice in Azure DevOps wiki pages is that there isn't just one top-level H1 header.

# Header 1

This is the first section.

## Header 1.1

This is subsection 1.1.

### Header 1.1.1

This is subsection 1.1.1.

### Header 1.1.2

This is subsection 1.1.2.

# Header 2

This is the second section.

### Header 2.1.1

(This is an incorrect jump from H1 to H3, but folks don't always write correct Markdown...)

# Header [3](https://github.com/tillig/vscode-azdo-toc)

This header has Markdown _inside the header_.
